    "Boosting is a machine learning ensemble technique used to improve the predictive performance of a model by combining multiple weak learners (models that perform slightly better than random guessing) into a single strong learner. Boosting aims to reduce bias and variance, making it particularly effective for improving the accuracy of classification and regression models."
