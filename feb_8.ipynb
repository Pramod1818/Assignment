    "Abstraction is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that focuses on representing the essential features of an object while hiding the unnecessary details. It allows you to create a simplified and more manageable representation of real-world entities.\n",

When using a Car object, you don't need to know the intricate details of how the engine starts or the mechanics of the transmission. The class abstracts away these complex operations, allowing you to interact with the car using a high-level interface."
