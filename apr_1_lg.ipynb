    "\n",
    "**1. Multicollinearity:**\n",
    "Multicollinearity occurs when predictor variables are highly correlated, leading to instability in coefficient estimates. This can make it difficult to interpret the impact of individual variables on the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",

    "Overfitting occurs when the model fits noise in the training data, leading to poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Use regularization: L1 (Lasso) or L2 (Ridge) regularization can help control model complexity.\n",
    "- Gather more data: More data can help the model generalize better.\n",
    "- Cross-validation: Evaluate the model's performance on validation data to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Imbalanced Classes:**\n",
    "Imbalanced class distribution can lead to biased model performance, where the model may favor the majority class.\n",

    "**Solution:**\n",
    "- Feature engineering: Add polynomial terms, interaction terms, or non-linear transformations of variables.\n",
    "- Use other algorithms: Consider non-linear models like decision trees, random forests, or support vector machines.\n",
