    "K-Means clustering is a widely used clustering technique with its own set of advantages and limitations when compared to other clustering methods.Some of the key advantages and limitations of K-Means clustering are following:\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simplicity: K-Means is relatively simple to understand and implement. It is an unsupervised learning method that assigns data points to clusters based on their proximity to cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficiency: K-Means is computationally efficient and can handle large datasets with many variables. It converges quickly, making it suitable for large-scale clustering tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability: K-Means can be easily parallelized, allowing it to scale efficiently to datasets with a high number of data points or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cluster Interpretability: The clusters produced by K-Means tend to be spherical and of approximately equal size. This can make the clusters easy to interpret and suitable for various applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linear Separability: K-Means works well when the clusters are linearly separable and have a roughly spherical shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to Initialization: K-Means is sensitive to the initial placement of cluster centroids. Different initializations can lead to different cluster assignments and results. Several runs with different initializations may be required to find the best solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assumes Equal Variance: K-Means assumes that clusters have equal variance, which may not be the case in some real-world datasets. This can lead to suboptimal results when clusters have varying shapes and sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Requires Predefined Number of Clusters (K): K-Means requires the user to specify the number of clusters (K) in advance. Determining the optimal K can be challenging and may require domain knowledge or the use of additional techniques like the elbow method or silhouette score.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sensitive to Outliers: Outliers can significantly impact K-Means results. Since it aims to minimize the sum of squared distances, outliers may distort the positions of cluster centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Limited to Linear Boundaries: K-Means assumes that clusters are separated by hyperplanes, making it less suitable for capturing complex nonlinear cluster boundaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "- May Not Handle Categorical Data: K-Means is primarily designed for numerical data and may not handle categorical features well. Preprocessing is required to adapt it to mixed-type data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- May Not Detect Non-Convex Clusters: K-Means tends to produce convex clusters, which may not capture non-convex or irregularly shaped clusters effectively.\n",
