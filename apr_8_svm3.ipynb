MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted house prices and the actual house prices. Lower MSE values indicate better model performance, meaning that the model's predictions are closer to the actual prices on average.We can use MSE to assess how well SVM regression model accurately predicts house prices based on the given dataset."
