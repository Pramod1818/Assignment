    "Artificial Intelligence (AI): Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, enabling them to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. It encompasses a wide range of technologies and techniques to create systems that can learn, reason, problem-solve, and interact with the environment. For example, AI can be used to develop chatbots that engage in natural language conversations, self-driving cars that navigate without human intervention, and recommendation systems that suggest products based on user preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML): Machine Learning is a subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed. It involves the use of algorithms that allow machines to identify patterns, make predictions, and learn from examples. For instance, email spam filters that learn to identify spam based on user feedback are a common application of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep Learning (DL): Deep Learning is a subset of machine learning that involves neural networks with multiple layers, allowing them to automatically learn and extract features from data. Deep learning has shown remarkable success in tasks such as image and speech recognition. An example is the use of deep learning to build image recognition systems capable of identifying objects in images."
