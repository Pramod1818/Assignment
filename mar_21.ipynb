    "Label Encoding: In label encoding, each unique category is assigned a unique integer label. This method is suitable for nominal data (no inherent order). For example, if you have colors like \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue,\" they can be encoded as 0, 1, and 2. However, label encoding might lead to misinterpretation of ordinal relationships if applied to ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding: Ordinal encoding assigns integer labels based on the ordinal relationship between categories. For instance, for education levels like \"High School,\" \"Bachelor's,\" \"Master's,\" and \"PhD,\" you could encode them as 0, 1, 2, and 3 to reflect the increasing educational levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: Consider a dataset of movie ratings: \"Bad,\" \"Average,\" \"Good,\" and \"Excellent.\" If we believe there's an inherent order in these ratings, you might choose ordinal encoding (0, 1, 2, 3). However, if you consider the ratings as nominal, label encoding (0, 1, 2, 3) could be a better option."
