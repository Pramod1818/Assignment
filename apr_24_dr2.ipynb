    "In mathematics and data science, a projection is a linear transformation that maps a vector from a higher-dimensional space onto a lower-dimensional subspace. In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), projections are used to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset while preserving as much variance as possible. PCA achieves this by finding a set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) basis vectors, called principal components, and projecting the data onto these components. Each principal component captures a certain amount of variance in the original data, and the projection onto a subset of these components retains the most important information while reducing dimensionality."

    "The optimization problem in PCA aims to find the principal components that maximize the variance of the projected data. More specifically, it seeks to maximize the variance of the projections while ensuring that the principal components are orthogonal (uncorrelated). Mathematically, PCA solves an eigenvalue problem on the covariance matrix of the data, where the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix represent the principal components, and the corresponding eigenvalues indicate the variance captured by each component. PCA sorts these eigenvalues in descending order, allowing you to select a subset of them that retains most of the variance in the data."

In PCA, the covariance matrix is central because it is used to find the principal components.

PCA identifies these components to transform the original data into a new coordinate system where they are orthogonal and capture the maximum variance. The covariance matrix helps PCA uncover the directions of highest data variance."

Selecting a higher number of principal components retains more of the original data's variance and may preserve fine-grained details, but it also results in a higher-dimensional representation. Conversely, selecting fewer principal components reduces dimensionality but may lead to information loss. To determine the optimal number of components, practitioners often use methods like scree plots, cumulative explained variance, or cross-validation to strike the right balance between dimensionality reduction and data preservation."
