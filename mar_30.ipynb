    "Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization penalties in its objective function. It aims to address some limitations of Lasso and Ridge Regression by striking a balance between feature selection (Lasso) and coefficient shrinkage (Ridge).\n",

    "\n",
    "- Combination of Penalties: Elastic Net combines the L1 and L2 regularization penalties, allowing it to inherit the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge Regression.\n",
    "- Flexibility: By adjusting the mixing parameter α, you can control the relative contributions of L1 and L2 penalties. When α = 0, Elastic Net becomes Ridge Regression, and when α = 1, it becomes Lasso Regression.\n",
    "- Feature Selection and Coefficient Shrinkage: Elastic Net strikes a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage, making it suitable for datasets with high dimensionality and multicollinearity."
