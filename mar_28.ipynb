    "Ridge Regression, also known as L2 regularization, is a linear regression technique that introduces a regularization term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function. It aims to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the sum of squared residuals, encouraging smaller coefficient values.\n",

    "Differences from Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Regularization Term: Ridge Regression adds a regularization term, often denoted as λ (lambda), to the objective function. This term penalizes the magnitudes of the regression coefficients.\n",
    "- Coefficient Shrinkage: Ridge Regression shrinks the coefficients towards zero, but it doesn't set them exactly to zero. This prevents coefficients from becoming too large and helps reduce overfitting.\n",
    "- Bias-Variance Trade-off: Ridge Regression introduces a trade-off between bias and variance. As λ increases, the bias increases and the variance decreases, leading to a balance that can result in better generalization to new data.\n",
    "- Prevents Multicollinearity Issues: Ridge Regression is effective in handling multicollinearity (high correlation among predictors) by reducing the impact of correlated predictors.\n",
