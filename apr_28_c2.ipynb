    "Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that builds a hierarchy of clusters, where each cluster contains subclusters. Unlike other clustering techniques like K-Means, hierarchical clustering does not require specifying the number of clusters in advance (i.e., the value of K). Instead, it produces a tree-like structure (dendrogram) that represents the relationship between data points and clusters. Hierarchical clustering can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down). It is different from other techniques in that it creates a nested structure of clusters rather than assigning each data point to a single cluster."
