    "Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that introduces L1 regularization. It adds a penalty term to the ordinary least squares (OLS) objective function, encouraging smaller coefficient values and promoting sparsity in the coefficient matrix. This means that Lasso can lead to some coefficients being exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection.\n",

    "\n",
    "Here's how Lasso Regression can be adapted for non-linear regression problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Feature Transformation:**\n",
    "   - Apply non-linear transformations to the input features, such as polynomial transformations (e.g., squaring, cubing), logarithmic transformations, or interaction terms.\n",
    "   - Transform the original features into a higher-dimensional space, where Lasso can capture non-linear relationships between the transformed features and the response variable.\n",
    "   - This approach effectively transforms the problem into a linear regression in the transformed feature space, allowing Lasso to perform feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Kernel Methods:**\n",
    "   - Use kernel methods to implicitly transform the feature space into a higher-dimensional space.\n",
    "   - Apply the kernel trick to calculate the dot products between the transformed features without explicitly computing the transformation.\n",
    "   - This allows Lasso Regression to capture non-linear relationships that exist in the transformed space.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensemble Techniques:**\n",
    "   - Combine Lasso Regression with ensemble techniques like Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "   - Ensemble methods can capture non-linear relationships by aggregating multiple weak learners (trees), which individually capture local non-linear patterns.\n",
    "   - The ensemble model can benefit from both the feature selection capabilities of Lasso and the non-linear modeling capacity of ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Generalized Linear Models (GLMs):**\n",
    "   - Use Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) with a Lasso penalty for non-linear regression problems with specific non-linear relationships.\n",
    "   - Choose appropriate link functions (e.g., log, exponential) and specify the distribution of the response variable based on the nature of the problem.\n",
    "   - Lasso regularization can help select relevant features and mitigate overfitting in the GLM framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Non-linear Extensions (Elastic Net):**\n",
    "   - Consider using Elastic Net, an extension of Lasso Regression that combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization.\n",
    "   - Elastic Net can handle both feature selection and capture non-linear relationships to some extent by striking a balance between the two types of regularization."

    "Yes, Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity in the input features to some extent. Multicollinearity occurs when two or more predictor variables are highly correlated, which can lead to instability in coefficient estimates in standard linear regression. Lasso Regression can address multicollinearity in the following ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coefficient Shrinkage:** Lasso introduces a penalty term that encourages smaller coefficient values. When predictor variables are highly correlated, Lasso tends to select one of the correlated variables and shrink the coefficients of the others towards zero. This helps reduce the impact of correlated variables on the model, making it more stable in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Automatic Feature Selection:** Lasso's ability to drive some coefficients exactly to zero means that it can automatically select relevant features and exclude less important ones. In the context of multicollinearity, Lasso might choose one of the correlated variables and eliminate the others with smaller coefficients. This feature selection process can effectively mitigate multicollinearity-related instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bias-Variance Trade-off:** By reducing the impact of multicollinear variables, Lasso helps strike a balance between bias and variance in the model. While multicollinearity can increase the variance of coefficient estimates in ordinary linear regression, Lasso's coefficient shrinkage helps reduce variance, leading to a more stable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** The regularization parameter λ (lambda) in Lasso Regression controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. Adjusting λ allows you to control the degree of coefficient shrinkage. In the presence of severe multicollinearity, increasing λ can lead to more aggressive coefficient shrinkage and feature selection."
