In contrast, a pair confusion matrix is designed for problems with a larger number of classes or when dealing with multi-label classification.\n",

    "- Imbalanced Datasets: Accuracy can be misleading in datasets where one class significantly outweighs the others. A model that predicts the majority class for all instances may achieve high accuracy but fail to capture the minority class, which is often of more interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost Sensitivity: In some applications, the cost of misclassifying certain classes may vary. Accuracy treats all classes equally, which may not align with real-world priorities.\n",

    "- Trade-Offs: Precision and recall, which are not considered in accuracy alone, provide insights into trade-offs between correctly identified instances (precision) and the ability to capture all relevant instances (recall).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context Matters: The choice of evaluation metric should align with the specific goals of the classification task. Precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC) are examples of metrics that provide more nuanced insights.\n",
